You are given:
1. A list of usernames with the form: $usernames
2. A discussion topic: $topic
3. A set of messages grouped by user, in the following format:

#foreach($user in $usernames)
$user:
#foreach($message in $messages.get($user))
$message
#end
#end

Requirements:
- Analyze which user presents the **best arguments** in relation to the given topic.
- Choose the user whose position is **better supported, clearer, more relevant to the topic**, and more logically sound.
- Only consider the content of the messages. Do not invent arguments or assumptions.
- Even if no user is perfectly aligned, choose the one who is **closest** to the topic and defends their position best.

Output:
- **Only return the username** (e.g., `dummy`)
- **Do not explain** your choice or include any extra words.
- Always return one username, even if it's a close call.

Expected output:
[username]
